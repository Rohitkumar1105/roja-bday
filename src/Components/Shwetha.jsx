            <p>For the beautiful soul☺️ who has a beautiful smile 🥰 ,wishing you happy birthday 🎂 may all your dreams come true ,be happy and make others happy with ur naughty talks 😁 and also party hard 🎊🎉🥳.
I would like to share a moment that I spent with you and rho ❣️, made my evening very pleasant , one day I fought with Vivek and I didn't know whom to tell wat I felt like ,instead you only came to me to ask weather I was doing fine or no ,then u both took me outside to eat chats ,u had made me realize about wat is life  and u shared many things . That ride with you and rho was a memory that I cannot forget. 
Like this I have many moments  where you supported me ,encouraged me and also made me smile 😊.</p>
