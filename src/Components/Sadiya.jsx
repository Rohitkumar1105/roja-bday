            <p> Dear Roja, </p>
            <p>First of all very very verryyyyy Happy Birthday :) </p>

            <p> Second off I'm so sorry for not making a video because I suck at it.
                AND my front camera my is in terrible condition </p>

            <p>So, here is my little letter/written message for you, I KNOW your lazy ass doesn't like reading my looong ass rants but still please read it :p </p>

            <p>It's been a year since we graduated, and oh boy time sure does fly!! 
                We've been through a lot of UP's & Down's in this past year & you surely have been through some hard times, 
                yet you stayed strong, fought hard, never gave up and after a lot of hardships, you've finally succeeded in finding a good stable job in a amazing company &
                I'm so soo proud of you *.*
                I pray to god that this coming year he fill's your life with a lot of happiness, success and joy. I pray that he blesses you with good health both physically and mentally.
                Always Remember this, Whatever happens please don't get stressed and please take care of yourself.
                I know how stressfull this year has been to you, but i hope you will stop overthinking & instead focus on happiness & positivity in your life.
                (Psstt taking stress is my job, I'm an expert in it LOL, So if you take any kind of stress I'm going to kick your ass!!! so don't you dare! =_=) </p>

            <p>lastly, thank you, thank you so much from the bottom of my heart, Thank you for always being there for me & for always taking care of me & for always staying in touch with me.
                This past year I've been a terrible friend, there were times I pushed you & all of my other friends away because I was too deep in self loathing & self pitying myself :(
                I had hit rock bottom & didn't know what to with myself or with my life anymore.....during these times you held onto me, you never gave up, you kept motivating me,
                kept advising, sometimes even knocked some sense into my brain whenever I was wrong and I'm really really thankful & grateful to have an amazing friend like you.
                Even though you had your own problems to deal with, you still found time & patience to deal with my dramatic ass, thank you once again for everything.</p>

            <p>And I'm really sorry for not being there for you, I was so immersed in my own problems that I didn't see your pain, your sufferings and your problems.
                I feel so giulty & awful that I wasn't there for you when you needed me and I'm really sorry (TT)
                I promise I'll try to be a better friend and a better person. I will try my best to be there for you as much as I can. </p>
